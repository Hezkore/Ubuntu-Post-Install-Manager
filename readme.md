# Ubuntu Post-Install Manager
A simple script that helps you get started with Ubuntu and GNOME.

## Requires a X11 session
If you don't know what this means, then just make sure you click the cog in the lower right corner when you're logging in and about to type your password, then select "Ubuntu on Xorg" and login as usual.

The reason for this is because some of the software - like IMWheel - does not work correctly in a Wayland session.

## How to install & run
Download the script by clicking the green **"Code â–¼"** button here on GitHub, then click **"Download Zip"** and save the file.\
Unpack the script by right clicking the script and selecting **"Extract Here"**, which creates the folder **"Ubuntu-Post-Install-Manager-master"**.\
Enter the folder **"Ubuntu-Post-Install-Manager-master"**, then right click *(don't right click a file or folder)* and select **"Open in Terminal"**.\
Then simply run the script by typing **"./ubuntu_pim.sh"** without the quotes and pressing Enter.\
*(Pro tip: you can press TAB after you've written **"./u"** to autocomplete the command)*

## Navigation & usage
Press the Up and Down arrow keys to move your selection up and down.\
Press TAB to move your selection between the lower two menu buttons.\
Press Enter to confirm your selection.\
Press Space to toggle a option on or off in the customize menu.

I recommend doing all the steps in order, unless you know what you're doing.\
The default options in each customization menu are the recommended options, which means you can simply press Enter to confirm.
